                        must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described when
                        embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                        are different, the validation rules are different by usage,
                        which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4.
                        The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is
                        not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                        interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                        the dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the
                        version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot
                        easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations,
                        updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                        make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not
                        control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided
                        and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For
                        example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular     restrictions like, "must
                        refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name
                        must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described when
                        embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                        are different, the validation rules are different by usage,
                        which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4.
                        The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is
                        not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                        interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                        the dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the
                        version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot
                        easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations,
                        updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                        make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not
                        control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided
                        and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions like, "must
                  refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                  be restricted".     Those cannot be well described when embedded.  3.
                  Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                  validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                  users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields are both imprecise
                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This
                  can produce ambiguity     during interpretation and require a REST
                  mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource
                  tuple     and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5.
                  We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many
                  locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                  make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                  Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                  that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                  for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"

                  the pod set is read from the controller's spec). If VerticalPodAutoscaler
                  cannot use specified target it will report ConfigUnsupported condition.
                  Note that VerticalPodAutoscaler does not require full implementation
                  of scale subresource - it will not use it to modify the replica
                  count. The only thing retrieved is a label selector matching pods
                  grouped by the target resource.
